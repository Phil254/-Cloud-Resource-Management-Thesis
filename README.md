# Cloud Computing: Design and Evaluation of a Quality-of-Service Aware Virtual Machine Allocation Algorithm

This repository contains the code and data for a Master of Science research project focusing on developing an intelligent virtual machine (VM) allocation algorithm for cloud computing environments. The research addresses the challenge of balancing multiple, competing performance objectives to ensure high-quality service delivery.

-----

### 1\. Problem Statement

Existing VM allocation algorithms often fail to simultaneously optimize for key performance metrics such as **Service Level Agreement (SLA) violations**, **makespan**, and **host resource utilization**. Simple heuristic algorithms are prone to poor performance, while single-objective meta-heuristic approaches fail to address the holistic needs of dynamic cloud workloads. This work proposes a solution that can navigate these complex trade-offs.

-----

### 2\. Proposed Solution: The SLA-PSO Algorithm

The core contribution of this research is the **SLA-Based Particle Swarm Optimization (SLA-PSO)** algorithm. This is a novel, multi-objective optimization solution that integrates several critical QoS metrics into a single, unified fitness function.

The SLA-PSO algorithm is designed to:

  * **Minimize SLA Violations**: By prioritizing the allocation of VMs in a way that meets resource demands and reduces service interruptions.
  * **Reduce Makespan**: By efficiently scheduling and completing all tasks in the shortest possible time.
  * **Balance Resource Utilization**: By distributing the workload across physical hosts to prevent bottlenecks and improve overall efficiency.

-----

### 3\. Methodology

The SLA-PSO algorithm was developed and evaluated within the **CloudSim toolkit**, a well-regarded simulation framework for cloud computing research. Its performance was rigorously compared against two benchmark algorithms:

  * **Best-Fit**: A simple, greedy heuristic that places a VM on the host with the tightest resource fit.
  * **Baseline-PSO**: A standard, single-objective Particle Swarm Optimization algorithm.

The comparison was conducted under various conditions, including scaling the number of VMs and hosts, and varying the cloud landscape from homogeneous to heterogeneous environments.

-----

### 4\. Key Findings

The empirical results demonstrate that the SLA-PSO algorithm consistently and significantly outperforms both the Best-Fit and Baseline-PSO benchmarks.

  * **Superior QoS Adherence**: SLA-PSO achieved a massive reduction in SLA violations compared to the benchmarks, confirming its effectiveness in prioritizing service quality.
  * **Improved Efficiency**: The algorithm was highly effective at minimizing makespan, leading to faster task completion.
  * **Inadequacy of Benchmarks**: The research highlights the limitations of simple and single-objective algorithms, which proved ill-equipped to handle the multi-faceted demands of modern cloud environments. The high failure rate of Best-Fit and the poor QoS performance of Baseline-PSO underscore the necessity of a holistic, multi-objective approach.

### 5\. How to Run the Simulation

To replicate the results of this research, follow these steps:

1.  **Clone the Repository**:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/Phil254/-Cloud-Resource-Management-Thesis.git
    cd Cloud-Resource-Management-Thesis
    ```

2.  **Install Dependencies**: The analysis requires Python and several data science libraries. You can install them using `pip`:

    ```bash
    pip install pandas matplotlib seaborn
    ```

3.  **Run the Analysis Script**:
    Place the `compare_sla_results.csv` file in the correct directory as per the script.
    The main analysis script, `plot_results.py`, can be executed from your terminal:

    ```bash
    python plot_results.py
    ```

The script will generate various plots and save them in a new `comparison_plots` directory, visualizing the performance of each algorithm.
